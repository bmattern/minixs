Until I get around to creating a proper installation setup, the code must be manually installed.

Lines that start with '$' below are unix command lines. The leading '$' represents the command prompt, and should not be typed.

Dependencies
============

The following python libraries are required (the ubuntu package names are also given):

* numpy        python-numpy
* scipy        python-scipy
* matplotlib   python-matplotlib
* wx           python-wxgtk2.8

To install these on ubuntu, run:

    $ sudo apt-get install <name of package(s)>

Alternatively, python and the required libraries can be installed via the
free version of the [Enthought Python Distribution (EPD)][EPD].

Environment configuration
=========================

The contents contents of the lib directory must be made available to python.

Linux or Mac OSX
----------------

Either

a) Add the lib/ directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

     $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/lib/

   If you would like this change to be permanent, add the above line to your shell's init script (e.g., $HOME/.bashrc)

  You can check that the path is set correctly by running

     $ echo $PYTHONPATH

OR

b) Copy (or symlink) lib/minixs into a directory that is already in your PYTHONPATH.

Windows
-------

Right click on "Computer" in the Start menu
Click "Properties"
Click "Advanced System Settings"
Click "Environment Variables"
Click "New"

Set "Variable name" to PYTHONPATH
Set "Variable value" to C:\path\to\lib  (replace with actual path)

Click Ok and close the environemtn variables window.

Running Scripts
===============

Once the environment has been configured, the calibrator gui can be run:

    $ ./bin/calibrator

If desired, this script can be copied or symlinked into a directory that is in your $PATH.

The processing scripts are all intended to be used from the command line.
Running any with the "-h" flag will display help text for the script.
