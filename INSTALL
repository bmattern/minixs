Until I get around to creating a proper installation setup, the code must be manually installed.

Lines that start with '$' below are unix command lines. The leading '$' represents the command prompt, and should not be typed.

Dependencies
------------
  The following python libraries are required (the ubuntu package names are also given):

  numpy        python-numpy
  scipy        python-scipy
  matplotlib   python-matplotlib
  wx           python-wxgtk2.8

  To install these on ubuntu, run:
    $ sudo apt-get install <name of package(s)>

Environment configuration
-------------------------
The contents contents of the lib directory must be made available to python. To do this, either (a) or (b) below:

  a) Add the lib/ directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

     $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/lib/

     If you would like this change to be permanent, add the above line to your shells init script (typically $HOME/.bashrc)

     You can check that the path si set correctly by running

     $ echo $PYTHONPATH

  OR

  b) Copy (or symlink) lib/minixs into a directory that is already in your PYTHONPATH.

Once this has been done, the calibrator gui can be run:

  $ ./bin/calibrator

If desired, this script can be copied or symlinked into a directory that is in your $PATH.
