Until I get around to creating a proper installation setup, the code must be manually installed.

The contents contents of the lib directory must be made available to python. To do this, either:

  a) Add the lib/ directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

     $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/lib/

  OR

  b) Copy (or symlink) lib/minixs into a directory that is already in your PYTHONPATH.

Once this has been done, the calibrator gui can be run:

  $ ./bin/calibrator

If desired, this script can be placed in a directory that is in your PATH.
